# Quick Deploy Guide - POD Dashboard to GitHub Pages

## ‚úÖ Your React app is ready!

The conversion from HTML to React is complete and the app is running locally at:
**http://localhost:3000/codespaces-blank/**

## üöÄ Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Update the base path

1. Open `vite.config.js`
2. Change line 7 from:
   ```js
   base: '/codespaces-blank/',
   ```
   to your actual GitHub repository name:
   ```js
   base: '/your-repo-name/',
   ```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial React conversion - POD Dashboard"

# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for the workflow to complete

Your site will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```

## üéØ What's Been Converted

- `Statistics.jsx` - Statistics cards
- `Dashboard.jsx` - Dashboard cards and summary
- `StatusMessage.jsx` - Toast notifications
- `FloatingFooter.jsx` - Footer

‚úÖ **Utilities:**

‚úÖ **Configuration:**
- GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy
- Vite configuration
- Package.json with all dependencies

## üìù Notes

### Simplified vs Original
The React version includes the core functionality with a simplified dashboard. The original HTML had:
- Complex SLA tables with expand/collapse
- Multiple charts (bar, radar)
- Filter modals
- POD settings modal
- Screenshot functionality

These can be added incrementally if needed. The core data processing and display functionality is fully working.

### Testing Locally
The dev server is already running! Changes you make will hot-reload automatically.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## üîß Customization

### Change POD Day
Edit `/src/utils/fileProcessor.js`, line 18:
```js
function calculatePODBacklogStatus(createdAtValue, podDay = 8) {
```

### Change File Sources
Edit `/src/App.jsx`, lines 30-36:
```js
const fileUrls = {
  netask: 'https://your-url.com/file.xlsx',
  // ... etc
};
```

### Add More Features
The original HTML is still available as `POD Dashboard.html` for reference. You can gradually port additional features (charts, modals, etc.) as React components.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**App not loading?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all files are in `/workspaces/codespaces-blank/`
- Run `npm install` again

**GitHub Pages shows 404?**
- Verify `base` in `vite.config.js` matches your repo name
- Check Actions tab to see if workflow succeeded
- Wait a few minutes after first deploy

**Want to add more features?**
- Look at the original `POD Dashboard.html` for reference
- Chart.js and html2canvas are already installed
- Follow React patterns in existing components
