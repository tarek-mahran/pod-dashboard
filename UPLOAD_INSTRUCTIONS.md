# üì§ Upload Instructions (Read-Only Token Workaround)

The Codespaces GITHUB_TOKEN has read-only permissions, so we can't push directly. 

## ‚úÖ **Easiest Solution: Download & Upload**

### Step 1: Download Your Code

Run this command in the terminal to create a ZIP file:

```bash
cd /workspaces/codespaces-blank
zip -r pod-dashboard-source.zip . -x "node_modules/*" "dist/*" ".git/*" "*.tar.gz"
```

Then download the ZIP file:
1. Click on `pod-dashboard-source.zip` in the file explorer (left sidebar)
2. Right-click ‚Üí Download

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/tarek-mahran/pod-dashboard
2. Click **"uploading an existing file"** or drag & drop
3. Extract the ZIP and upload all files
4. Commit the changes

### Step 3: Deploy

After files are uploaded, run in a new Codespace or locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarek-mahran/pod-dashboard.git
cd pod-dashboard
npm install
npm run deploy
```

## üöÄ **Better Solution: Deploy Build Files Directly**

Since we already built the production files, you can deploy them right now:

### Option A: Manual Upload to `gh-pages` Branch

1. Go to: https://github.com/tarek-mahran/pod-dashboard
2. Click **Add file** ‚Üí **Upload files**
3. Switch to `gh-pages` branch (create it if needed)
4. Upload everything from the `dist` folder
5. Commit

Then enable Pages:
- Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Source: `gh-pages` branch, `/` root
- Save

Your site will be live at: https://tarek-mahran.github.io/pod-dashboard/

---

### Option B: Use GitHub Actions (Automated)

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file is already in your code. Once you get the code into GitHub (via upload), every push will auto-deploy!

---

## üéØ **Recommended: Use GitHub Desktop or Git Locally**

If you have access to a local machine:

1. Clone this Codespace to your machine
2. Install Git locally  
3. Push from there (you'll have full permissions)

```bash
git clone <this-codespace-url>
cd pod-dashboard
git remote add origin https://github.com/tarek-mahran/pod-dashboard.git
git push -u origin main
npm run deploy
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ Repository created: `tarek-mahran/pod-dashboard`
‚úÖ Production build completed: `dist` folder ready
‚úÖ All source files ready
‚ö†Ô∏è  Can't push from Codespace (read-only token)

**Next**: Download ZIP and upload to GitHub, or clone to local machine with write access
